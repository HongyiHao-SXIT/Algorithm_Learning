# Algorithm Learning Repository: (Problems from Luogu, LeetCode, and AcWing)

## I. Repository Introduction
This repository is a collection of my achievements in the process of algorithm learning. It mainly contains the C++ code implementations of problems from the Luogu, LeetCode, and AcWing platforms. Each piece of code reflects my understanding and practice of algorithms, and I hope it can provide reference and inspiration for other algorithm learners.

## III. Code Explanation

### Code Specification
All code follows the C++ standard syntax specification and uses common naming conventions. Variable and function names have clear meanings, which facilitates understanding of the code logic.

### Comment Explanation
Each piece of code is accompanied by detailed comments, including:
- **Problem Description**: Briefly summarize the main content and requirements of the problem.
- **Thought Process Analysis**: Explain the problem-solving idea and the reason for choosing the algorithm.
- **Complexity Analysis**: Analyze the time complexity and space complexity of the code to help understand the efficiency of the algorithm.

## IV. Usage Instructions

### Compiling and Running the Code
For each C++ file, you can use the `g++` compiler to compile it. For example, to compile the code for LeetCode problem 1:
```bash
g++ leetcode/0001_two_sum.cpp -o two_sum
./two_sum
```

### Code Debugging and Learning
You can debug and modify the code according to your own needs. Combine the problem description and comments to gain a deeper understanding of the implementation details of the algorithm.

## V. Learning Resources and References
In the process of solving these problems, I referred to many excellent learning resources, including but not limited to:
- Relevant algorithm books, such as *Introduction to Algorithms* and *Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis*.
- Tutorials and explanatory videos on online learning platforms, such as algorithm teaching videos on Bilibili and courses on AcWing.
- Problem solutions and blog articles by other algorithm learners to obtain different problem-solving ideas and methods.

I hope this repository can be helpful for everyone's algorithm learning. Let's make continuous progress on the path of algorithm learning together!
